# Manual test: wallet flows on Stellar Testnet

These steps cover what automated checks can't: a real browser wallet signing real testnet transactions. Nothing here uses mainnet or real money. Tick each box and note what you saw; anything that doesn't match is a bug.

**Status:** every step below is **unverified**. The port was done without a browser wallet. The automated checks (unit tests, `npm run e2e:testnet`, the backend smoke test) cover the read paths and signing logic, but no human has clicked through these yet.

## Before you start: two known blockers

1. **Test USDC can only be minted by the deployer key.** The collateral is a self-issued test asset (`USDC` issued by `GD2NB2VUME7ECMHFHQN5M3KUZLLJF3R6Z4OFCBLE4SJNHIQHITRPQGHQ`, wrapped as the SAC `CA2WQQJ4OHQCLHQW6XN4BCLILGRV6V4YDYDT3GVIWXB53BTOO7EMREQH`). There is no faucet, so step 4 needs a maintainer (see [contract-requests.md](contract-requests.md) #3).
2. **Both existing testnet markets are closed.** Markets 0 and 1 were created by the contracts repo's demo with a 90-second trading window on 2026-09-21; market 0 is resolved YES. Buying on them fails with "This market has closed". Step 7 therefore needs a fresh, open market (see below).

## You need

- Chrome, Brave or Firefox with [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) installed.
- The backend running locally (its README quick start, plus `scripts/smoke.sh` passing).
- This app running: `cp .env.example .env.local`, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1`, then `npm run dev`.

## 1. Install Freighter and create a test account

- [ ] Install the Freighter extension and create a new wallet. **Use a fresh wallet for testing; don't import a key that holds real funds.**
- [ ] Copy your public key (starts with `G`).

## 2. Switch Freighter to Testnet

- [ ] Freighter → Settings → Network → **Test Net**.

## 3. Fund the account with Friendbot

- [ ] Open `https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=<YOUR_G_ADDRESS>` (or Freighter's "Fund with Friendbot" button).
- [ ] Freighter shows about 10,000 XLM.

## 4. Get test USDC

a. **Add the trustline** (the account must trust the asset before it can hold it):

- [ ] Freighter → Manage assets → Add manually: code `USDC`, issuer `GD2NB2VUME7ECMHFHQN5M3KUZLLJF3R6Z4OFCBLE4SJNHIQHITRPQGHQ`. Approve the transaction.

b. **Ask a maintainer to mint.** With the deployer key from `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` (the CLI identity `oracledesk-deployer`), they run:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id CA2WQQJ4OHQCLHQW6XN4BCLILGRV6V4YDYDT3GVIWXB53BTOO7EMREQH \
  --source-account oracledesk-deployer --network testnet \
  -- mint --to <YOUR_G_ADDRESS> --amount 1000000000   # 100 USDC (7 decimals)
```

- [ ] Freighter shows 100 USDC.

## 5. Connect

- [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000`, click **Connect Wallet**, choose Freighter, approve.
- [ ] You're taken to `/markets` once. Reload the page: you stay where you are and are still connected (the old app redirected on every reload).
- [ ] Freighter asks you to sign a transaction for OracleDesk login. It is never submitted; it proves you own the key. Approve it.
- [ ] Expected: no error under the button. In DevTools → Application → Local Storage, `oracledesk_wallet` equals your address.

## 6. See your balance

- [ ] Open the wallet menu (top right). It says **Stellar Testnet** and shows **100.00 USDC**.
- [ ] Switch Freighter to Mainnet: the menu shows **Wrong network** in red. Switch back to Testnet.
- [ ] "Copy address" copies your G-address; "View on Stellar Expert" opens your testnet account page.
- [ ] `/portfolio/wallets` shows the same balance; its chart and history table carry a "Demo data" label.

## 7. Buy YES

First, a maintainer opens a market that stays open long enough to trade. In the contracts repo (`oracledesk-stellar/`):

```bash
# 150 USDC seed, 50/50 start, closes in 7 days, 1-day dispute window
./scripts/seed-market.sh 1500000000 5000 604800 86400 "Manual test market"
# note the market_id it prints, e.g. market_id=2
```

Then in the app:

- [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000/markets/quick-view?onChainId=<market_id>`. Status shows **OPEN** with a `chain` tag, and YES is about 50%.
- [ ] Select **YES**, enter `10`. A quote appears: "≈ N shares, at least M (1% slippage)".
- [ ] Click **Buy YES**. Freighter shows a `buy` call on market-core (`CC4MMHWZ…`). Approve.
- [ ] A success line shows the shares received and a Stellar Expert link. The transaction there shows `buy` with `min_shares_out` equal to the "at least" figure.
- [ ] The wallet menu balance drops by 10 USDC.
- [ ] Optional, slippage: start a buy, and before approving, buy a large amount from another account. Approving the first should fail with "The price moved before your trade went through…".

To try the same on market 0 (resolved): the buy button is disabled and the panel says "This market is closed to trading". That is the expected result.

## 8. See your position

- [ ] On the same page: "Your position: N YES · 0 NO" with a `chain` tag.
- [ ] The YES price moved up from 50%.

## 9. Verify a trace

- [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000/reasoning/verify?onChainTraceId=1` and click **Begin verification**.
- [ ] Expected: the log shows `reasoning_registry.get_trace(1)`, the on-chain hash `38f728a8…`, then **Content unavailable**. The demo published that trace with the placeholder CID `ipfs://demo-trace-placeholder`, so no gateway can serve it. The page must not show any trace content.
- [ ] To see a **verified** result you need a trace whose content is really on IPFS: run the backend with Pinata keys and `CHAIN_EXECUTION_MODE=live` on testnet so it publishes one, then open `/reasoning/verify?traceId=<backend trace id>`. (Not yet done; see docs/STATUS.md.)
- [ ] For the hash check itself, `npm run e2e:testnet` (header of `e2e/testnet.e2e.test.ts`) verifies the demo trace's reconstructed bytes against the chain and rejects a tampered copy.

## 10. Disconnect

- [ ] Wallet menu → Disconnect. The button returns to **Connect Wallet**, and `oracledesk_token` is gone from Local Storage.

## Also worth clicking

- [ ] `/premium` → **Get a daily pass** → **Pay with wallet**. Freighter shows a USDC `transfer` to the treasury (`CBTFA3EP…`) for 0.50 USDC. After approval the backend verifies it on-chain and says the pass is active. Note: until `PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT` is decided, this payment becomes treasury trading capital (see docs/STATUS.md).
- [ ] `/copy-trade?marketId=<backend market id>&traceId=<trace id>`: the side comes from the trace's edge. With no trace or zero edge the confirm button is disabled and the page explains why.
- [ ] `/admin` with an address not in `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESSES` shows "Access Denied".
