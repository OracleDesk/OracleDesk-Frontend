# Status

Last updated: 2026-10-07. This is the honest account of the frontend's Stellar port: what works, what isn't verified, and what a human has to decide. "Verified" means a command was run and its output observed in the session that wrote this file. The backend's [docs/STATUS.md](https://github.com/OracleDesk/OracleDesk-Backend/blob/main/docs/STATUS.md) covers the server side.

## ⚠️ Action required before anything else

1. **Your local `.env` holds private keys under `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` names.** It isn't committed, but it defines `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY` (both 66 characters, i.e. EVM private keys), `NEXT_PUBLIC_CIRCLE_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYMARKET_API_KEY`. Next.js compiles every *referenced* `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value into browser JavaScript. No tracked code ever referenced these (`git log -S` over all history: 0 hits), and none of the values appear in the new build's `.next/static`. Still:
   - Delete them from `.env` (the new app reads only the variables in `.env.example`).
   - Remove them from any hosting environment (e.g. Vercel project settings).
   - If a deployment ever shipped them, treat the keys as compromised.
2. **Rotate the Circle credentials** committed in the backend's `.env.example` history (details in the backend STATUS).

## Toolchain

Node v24.13.1, npm 11.8.0 (CI: Node 22 via `.nvmrc`), Next.js 16.2.6 (Turbopack), React 19.2.4, TypeScript 5.9.3, `@tanstack/react-query` 5.100.10, `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 16.3.1, `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit` 2.5.0 (pinned exactly), Vitest 5.0.3, gitleaks 8.30.1, Stellar CLI 27.1.0. Contracts submodule at `OracleDesk-SmartContract@eb5f3fd` (that repo's `main` HEAD).

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Recon and safety | ✅ | Submodule fixed; scrap files deleted; gitleaks clean; `docs/PORTING.md`; baseline below |
| A. API contract | ✅ | `docs/api.md` (copy of the backend's) maps every `lib/api` call |
| C1. Dependencies | ✅ | No `wagmi`/`viem`/`@reown`/`@rainbow-me` import or dependency (grep below) |
| C2. Bindings sync | ✅ | `npm run check:bindings` |
| C3. `lib/stellar` | ✅ code, ⚠️ wallet unverified | Unit tests; the wallet provider needs a browser extension |
| C4. Hooks | ✅ reads verified live, ⚠️ writes unverified | `npm run e2e:testnet` exercises reads; writes need a wallet |
| C5. Pages | ✅ build, ⚠️ not clicked through | All routes prerender; manual plan in `docs/manual-test.md` |
| C6. Suspense build failure | ✅ | Reproduced and fixed (below) |
| C7. Tests | ✅ | 21 Vitest tests |
| D. End to end | ✅ read paths | See below |
| E. Contributor readiness | ✅ files, ⚠️ CI never ran on GitHub | README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CoC, LICENSE, templates, CI |
| F. Backlog | ✅ | 14 drafts in `docs/wave-issues/` (5 good first issues) |

## Baseline (before any change)

- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0.
- `npx eslint`: **exit 1, 319 errors and 104 warnings.** About 290 errors came from linting the vendored `OracleDesk-Backend/dist` and `contracts/` submodules; 31 errors were in app code.
- `npx next build`: exit 0. Every route was dynamic (ƒ), because the layout called `headers()` for wagmi. That's why the known `useSearchParams` prerender failure did **not** reproduce at baseline.
- `git clone --recurse-submodules` was broken: the recorded `OracleDesk-Backend` commit `207464d` doesn't exist on GitHub.

## Secrets scan

- `gitleaks detect --log-opts=--all` (19 commits): no leaks.
- Regex sweep of `git log -p --all`: `MAX_UINT256` constants and a Polymarket builder code (`0xe4e1…`, a public identifier). No secrets.
- Every commit on this branch was scanned first with `gitleaks git --pre-commit --staged`.

## Fully verified (commands run, output observed)

- `npm run typecheck` 0 · `npm run lint` 0 · `npm run check:bindings` 0 · `npm test` 0 (4 files, 21 tests) · `npm run build` 0 with all 27 routes prerendered as static.
- `grep -rnE "from ['\"](wagmi|viem|@reown|@rainbow-me)" app components lib` → no matches; package.json has none of them.
- **C6:** with the `<Suspense>` boundary temporarily removed from `/markets/quick-view`, `next build` failed with "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page /markets/quick-view … Export encountered an error". With it restored, the build passes. `/copy-trade` and `/reasoning/verify` use the same pattern.
- A fresh `git clone --recurse-submodules -b feat/stellar-port` of this repo checks out `contracts` at `eb5f3fd`, and `npm ci`, `check:bindings`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` and `build` pass in it.
- The built app served by `next start`: `/`, `/markets`, `/markets/quick-view?onChainId=1`, `/reasoning/verify?onChainTraceId=1`, `/premium`, `/copy-trade` → HTTP 200. The backend's CORS preflight from `http://localhost:3000` → 204 with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000` and credentials allowed.

## Phase D: `npm run e2e:testnet` against the local backend (dry-run) and live testnet

```
API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1 EXPECTED_YES_BPS=5319 MARKET_ID=1 \
DEMO_TRACE_FILE=<rebuilt demo trace bytes> DEMO_TRACE_ID=1 npm run e2e:testnet
→ Tests 3 passed (3)
```

1. Backend market `e2e-market-1` (seeded in the local DB with `onChainMarketId = "1"`) joined to `get_market(1)`: yesBps 5319, Resolved, category matches. The backend's cached `currentYesProb` was 0.5, which shows why the UI labels each value's source.
2. FPMM `yesBps` 5319 = binding `get_price` 5319 = CLI `stellar contract invoke … -- get_price --market_id 1 --outcome Yes` → 5319.
3. Login with a throwaway keypair: backend `scripts/smoke.sh`, passed.
4. Trace #1 from `scripts/demo.sh`: bytes rebuilt from the script's template hash to the on-chain `38f728a8…` and verify; a tampered copy is a mismatch; the real gateway can't serve the placeholder CID, so it's `unavailable` and no content is rendered.

## Not verified (and how to verify)

Everything that needs a browser wallet. Follow [docs/manual-test.md](manual-test.md), which lists every click:

| Item | Blocker |
|---|---|
| Connect, persisted session restore, no redirect on reload | Needs a wallet extension |
| SEP-10 sign-in from the browser (the backend side is verified by script) | Needs a wallet |
| Buy, position update, slippage failure | Needs a wallet, test USDC (deployer key mints) and an **open** market (both testnet markets are closed; `seed-market.sh` makes one) |
| Daily-pass payment + backend verification | Needs a wallet and test USDC |
| Wrong-network label | Needs a wallet on a non-testnet network |
| Trace shown as **verified** in the UI | Needs a trace whose content is really on IPFS (demo traces use a placeholder CID) |
| `useSell`, `useRedeem` | Implemented, no UI yet (backlog #01, #02) |
| x402 per-trace unlock | No client yet (backlog #09); no x402 facilitator is known |
| CI workflow | Never pushed |

## Decisions made, and why

- **Removed the `OracleDesk-Backend` submodule** rather than bumping it: the frontend talks to the backend over HTTP only, and the recorded commit was unpushed. Its unpushed commit (`207464d`, a padded `/portfolio/stats` endpoint) was preserved as the backend branch `rescued/platform-stats-207464d`. The local checkout was moved, not deleted, to `../OracleDesk-Frontend.backend-submodule-backup` (it had an untracked `prisma/dev.db`).
- **Wallets Kit 2.5.0, pinned exactly.** 2.6+ depends on SDK 17, while the bindings are generated for SDK 16. 2.5.0 keeps a single SDK copy. `^2.5.0` would have floated to 2.7.
- **`@types/node` 20 → 22,** required by Vitest 5; matches the Node 22 CI.
- **Premium page shows the backend's real product** (a 24-hour pass, default 0.50 USDC) instead of "$20 / $50 per month" tiers nothing implemented. Card payment is marked not available.
- **Copy-trade uses the backend for intent and access checks, and the wallet signs `market_core.buy` directly.** It refuses with no trace or zero edge.
- **Demo data is labelled, not replaced** with new invented numbers, where no real data source exists yet (stats panels, home feeds, wallet history, transaction screens).
- **ESLint ignores `contracts/` and generated code.** Two real bugs were found while fixing the remaining lint errors: the positions table read `pos.amount`, which the backend never sends (the field is `size`), and labelled every row "POLYMARKET". Both are fixed.
- **Admin pages are a UI gate only;** the backend enforces `ADMIN_ADDRESSES`. Matching is exact, because G-addresses are uppercase (the old code lowercased them).
- **License: MIT,** matching the contracts repo (the frontend had none).

## Decisions left for a human

1. Clear the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` secrets from `.env` and hosting; rotate the Circle credentials (top of this file).
2. **Where payments go:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT` defaults to the treasury, which makes subscription revenue agent trading capital. Must match the backend's `PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT`.
3. **EURC:** dropped (single-collateral contracts). See the backend STATUS.
4. **Submodules:** `contracts` kept and pinned at `eb5f3fd`; `OracleDesk-Backend` removed. Delete `../OracleDesk-Frontend.backend-submodule-backup` once you're happy nothing in it is needed.
5. **License:** MIT. Confirm.
6. **SECURITY contact:** placeholder `SECURITY-CONTACT-TBD@example.invalid` in `SECURITY.md`.
7. **Pricing:** what the paid tiers should be, now that the page shows the one product the backend sells.
8. **Test USDC access** for outside contributors: today only the deployer key can mint (contract-requests #3).
