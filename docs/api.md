# OracleDesk backend API (Stellar)

This is the contract between `OracleDesk-Frontend` and this backend. The
Soroban contracts in `OracleDesk-SmartContract/oracledesk-stellar` are the
source of truth for anything on-chain; this API never overrides them.

Base URL: `/api/v1` (health is at `/health`).

## Conventions

### Envelope

Every response, success or error:

```json
{ "ok": true,  "data": { }, "error": null, "meta": { } }
{ "ok": false, "data": null, "error": { "code": "SOME_CODE", "message": "Readable text", "details": { } } }
```

`meta` is optional. List endpoints put pagination there:
`{ "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 57, "totalPages": 3 }`.

### Auth

Protected routes take `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. The JWT comes from
`POST /auth/verify` and lasts 7 days. Errors: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`,
`401 INVALID_TOKEN`, `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED` (the frontend clears its session on
the last one).

Routes marked **optional auth** work without a token and return more when
one is present.

### Identifiers and amounts

| Kind | JSON type | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend ids (`id`, `marketId`, `traceId`) | string (UUID) | `"8c1f…"` | Database ids. |
| `onChainMarketId` | decimal string or `null` | `"0"` | market-core `u64` id, 0-based and sequential (`0 … market_count()-1`). Never a JS number. `null` until the creation tx is confirmed. |
| `onChainTraceId` | decimal string or `null` | `"3"` | reasoning-registry `u64` trace id. |
| On-chain amounts | decimal string, name ends in `Raw` | `"10000000"` | i128 in USDC base units, **7 decimals** (1 USDC = `10000000`). |
| Display amounts | number | `12.5` | Floats for display only. Never build a transaction from them. |
| Probabilities | number 0–1 | `0.62` | Display. On-chain prices are basis points (`yesBps`, 0–10000). |
| Stellar addresses | string | `"GABC…"` / `"CABC…"` | `G…` accounts, `C…` contracts. Case-sensitive (StrKey is uppercase). |
| Hashes | lowercase hex, no `0x` | `"9f86…"` | sha256, 64 chars. Stellar tx hashes are also 64 hex chars. |

### Categories

The backend keeps its finer categories for display and filtering. Markets go
on-chain with the contract `Category`, via `toContractCategory()` in
`src/lib/categories.ts`:

| Backend `category` | Contract `Category` |
|---|---|
| `FED`, `ECB`, `MACRO` | `Macro` |
| `GEOPOLITICAL`, `ELECTION`, `POLITICS` | `Geopolitics` |
| `CRYPTO` | `Crypto` |
| `SPORTS` | `Sports` |
| `ENTERTAINMENT` | `Culture` |

The contract's `Other` has no backend category. The switch is exhaustive, and
a unit test fails if either enum gains a member.

API responses include both: `category` (backend) and `contractCategory`.

### Settlement currency

**Decision: `EURC` is dropped.** market-core takes exactly one collateral
token (the USDC SAC in `deployments/testnet.json`), so a market can't settle
in EURC. Keeping it "display-only" would label markets with a currency they
can't trade in. A migration maps any existing `EURC` rows to `USDC` and
removes the enum value. `settlementCurrency` stays in responses (always
`"USDC"`) so the frontend doesn't break; the `currency` filter on
`GET /markets` accepts only `USDC`.

## Endpoints

### Health

`GET /health` → `{ status: "healthy", uptime: number }`

### Auth (signed challenge, SEP-10 style)

The old `POST /auth/connect` issued a JWT for any address it was handed, so
anyone could log in as anyone. **It is removed.**

**Why a challenge transaction rather than a signed message:** every Stellar
wallet can `signTransaction`. `signMessage` (SEP-53) isn't universal: in
`@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit` 2.5.0 the Ledger, Trezor, Albedo, Bitget,
Klever and OneKey modules throw or report it unsupported. The challenge is
built and verified with `WebAuth.buildChallengeTx` /
`readChallengeTx` / `verifyChallengeTxSigners` from `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
16.3. It is a transaction with sequence number 0 that can never be submitted
to the network; signing it proves control of the key and spends nothing.

#### `POST /auth/challenge`

Rate-limited. Request:

```json
{ "address": "GABC…" }
```

`address` must pass `StrKey.isValidEd25519PublicKey`.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "transaction": "<base64 TransactionEnvelope XDR>",
  "networkPassphrase": "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
  "expiresAt": "2026-10-07T15:05:00.000Z"
}
```

The challenge is stored in Redis under its transaction hash with a 300 s TTL.

Errors: `400 INVALID_ADDRESS`, `429 RATE_LIMITED`.

#### `POST /auth/verify`

Rate-limited. Request:

```json
{ "address": "GABC…", "signed": "<base64 XDR signed by the wallet>" }
```

The server checks, in order:

1. `readChallengeTx` passes: signed by the server key, time bounds still
   valid, home domain and web-auth domain match.
2. The challenge's client account equals `address`.
3. The challenge exists in Redis and is deleted atomically (`GETDEL`), so a
   challenge works once. It's consumed even if a later check fails.
4. `verifyChallengeTxSigners(..., [address], ...)` returns exactly
   `[address]`.

Response `200`:

```json
{ "token": "<jwt>", "userId": "<uuid>", "walletAddress": "GABC…" }
```

Errors: `400 INVALID_ADDRESS`, `400 INVALID_CHALLENGE` (malformed XDR),
`401 CHALLENGE_EXPIRED`, `401 CHALLENGE_NOT_FOUND` (unknown or already
used), `401 CHALLENGE_SIGNATURE_INVALID` (wrong signer, missing signature,
address mismatch).

Multisig accounts: only a signature from `address`'s own key is accepted.
Threshold-based SEP-10 verification is a backlog item.

### Markets

#### Market object

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "question": "Will …?",
  "category": "CRYPTO",
  "contractCategory": "Crypto",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "settlementCurrency": "USDC",
  "initialYesProb": 0.62,
  "currentYesProb": 0.64,
  "confidenceInterval": { "lower": 0.55, "upper": 0.7 },
  "totalLiquidity": 150,
  "seedAmountRaw": "1500000000",
  "expiryTimestamp": "2026-11-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "onChainMarketId": "0",
  "creationTxHash": "a1b2…",
  "questionHash": "64-hex",
  "metaUri": "ipfs://bafy…",
  "resolutionHash": "64-hex",
  "resolutionSpec": { "kind": "signers", "threshold": 1, "disputeWindow": 3600, "signers": ["G…"] },
  "createdAt": "…",
  "marketUrl": null,
  "_count": { "trades": 0, "reasoningTraces": 1, "positions": 0 }
}
```

`onChainAddress` (Arc) is removed. Prices, reserves and on-chain status come
from market-core; the frontend reads them directly with
`get_market(onChainMarketId)`. `currentYesProb` and `totalLiquidity` are the
backend's cached display values and can lag the chain.

`resolutionSpec` is the revealed preimage of `resolutionHash` (ADR 0001).
Publishing it doesn't weaken the commitment: the hash was fixed on-chain
before trading, so the spec can't change, and anyone may reveal it to the
resolver.

#### `GET /markets`

Query: `status` (`PENDING|ACTIVE|RESOLVING|RESOLVED|CANCELLED`), `category`
(backend category), `currency` (`USDC`), `onChain` (`true` → only markets
with an `onChainMarketId`), `page`, `limit` (≤ 100).
Response: `Market[]`, pagination in `meta`.

#### `GET /markets/:id`

`:id` is the backend UUID. Response: `Market` plus up to 5 `reasoningTraces`
previews `{ id, agentType, edge, probabilityEstimate, verified, onChainTraceId, createdAt }`.
`404 MARKET_NOT_FOUND`.

#### `GET /markets/on-chain/:onChainMarketId`

Looks up the backend record for a market-core id. Same response as
`GET /markets/:id`. `400 INVALID_MARKET_ID` unless it's a decimal `u64`
string; `404 MARKET_NOT_FOUND`.

#### `GET /markets/on-chain/:onChainMarketId/state`

`market_core.get_market` read live from the network (no database), plus
`yesBps` from the contract's FPMM math:

```json
{
  "onChainMarketId": "0",
  "category": "Macro",
  "close_time": "1789998457",
  "creator": "C…",
  "fee_bps": 100,
  "fees_accrued": "1000000",
  "lp_claimed": false,
  "meta_uri": "ipfs://…",
  "question_hash": "64-hex",
  "reserve_no": "1599000000",
  "reserve_yes": "1407129456",
  "resolution_hash": "64-hex",
  "sets_minted": "1599000000",
  "status": { "tag": "Resolved", "outcome": "Yes" },
  "yesBps": 5319,
  "source": "chain"
}
```

`502 CHAIN_ERROR` with `details.contractError: "MarketNotFound"` for an
unknown id.

#### `POST /markets/generate` (auth, admin, rate-limited)

Starts one market-maker cycle in the background. Admin means the JWT's
`walletAddress` is in the server's `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` allowlist; the frontend
check is only a UI gate.

Request (all optional; the current agent ignores them and picks a topic from
live signals, which is recorded as a backlog item):

```json
{ "question": "…", "category": "CRYPTO", "expiry": "2026-11-01" }
```

Response `202`: `{ jobId, message, statusUrl, hint }`.
Errors: `403 FORBIDDEN` (not an admin), `429 RATE_LIMITED`.

#### `GET /markets/generation-status/:jobId` (auth)

Response: `{ jobId, status: "RUNNING"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"UNKNOWN", startedAt, completedAt, elapsedMs, marketId?, onChainMarketId?, question?, category?, marketUrl?, error? }`.

In `dry-run` mode a completed job has `onChainMarketId: null`: the creation
was simulated, not submitted.

### Reasoning traces

#### Trace object

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "marketId": "uuid",
  "onChainMarketId": "0",
  "agentType": "MARKET_MAKER",
  "decisionType": "MARKET_CREATION",
  "edge": 0.12,
  "probabilityEstimate": 0.62,
  "marketProbability": 0.5,
  "confidenceInterval": { "lower": 0.55, "upper": 0.7 },
  "verified": true,
  "ipfsCid": "bafy…",
  "traceHash": "64-hex",
  "onChainTraceId": "3",
  "publishTxHash": "…",
  "previewSources": [{ "source": "FRED", "weight": 0.9, "signal": "…" }],
  "market": { "question": "…", "category": "CRYPTO", "settlementCurrency": "USDC" },
  "createdAt": "…"
}
```

`traceHash` is the sha256 of the exact bytes pinned to IPFS (renamed from
`sha256Hash`, which hashed a re-serialised object). `verified` is the
backend's last check against reasoning-registry. The frontend must still run
its own check before rendering content (see `docs/frontend-integration.md` in
the contracts repo).

#### `GET /traces`

Query: `agentType`, `marketId`, `page`, `limit`. Response: preview traces,
pagination in `meta`.

#### `GET /traces/:id` (optional auth)

Without access: the preview (first two sources) plus
`{ accessLevel: "FREE_PREVIEW", lockedFields, unlockPriceRaw, dailyPassPriceRaw }`.
With a daily pass: the full trace and `accessLevel: "DAILY_PASS"`.
(Previously the route never read the token, so subscribers always got the
preview. Fixed.)

#### `POST /traces/verify` (auth)

Request `{ "traceId": "uuid" }`. The server reads
`reasoning_registry.get_trace(onChainTraceId)`, fetches `ipfs_cid` through the
gateway, hashes the exact bytes and compares them with the on-chain
`trace_hash` (same check as `x402/trace-verification.ts`).

Response:

```json
{
  "traceId": "uuid",
  "onChainTraceId": "3",
  "ipfsCid": "bafy…",
  "onChainHash": "64-hex",
  "computedHash": "64-hex",
  "storedHash": "64-hex",
  "verified": true,
  "verifiedAt": "…"
}
```

Errors: `404 TRACE_NOT_FOUND`, `409 TRACE_NOT_PUBLISHED` (no on-chain trace
id yet), `502 IPFS_RETRIEVAL_FAILED`, `502 CHAIN_READ_FAILED`.

#### `POST /traces/:id/unlock` (auth)

Daily pass only. Per-trace unlocks go through x402 (below).

Request:

```json
{ "txHash": "64-hex", "amountRaw": "5000000", "type": "DAILY_PASS" }
```

`amount` (a float) is still accepted for one release and converted with
7-decimal string maths; `amountRaw` wins when both are present. The amount is
informational: the server uses what the transaction actually moved.

The server calls Stellar RPC `getTransaction(txHash)` and grants access only
if **all** of these hold:

1. `status === "SUCCESS"`.
2. The transaction's single operation is `invokeHostFunction` →
   `invokeContract` on `USDC_CONTRACT_ID` with function `transfer`.
3. Arg 0 (`from`) equals the JWT's `walletAddress`.
4. Arg 1 (`to`) equals `PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT`.
5. Arg 2 (`amount`, i128) ≥ the tier price in base units
   (`DAILY_PASS_PRICE_RAW`, default `5000000` = 0.50 USDC).
6. The hash hasn't been used before (unique `txHash` on `PaymentEvent`).

There is no development bypass: an unverifiable payment never grants
access. Tests inject a fake RPC client.

Response `201`: `{ subscription, trace }`.
Errors: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, `402 PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND`,
`402 PAYMENT_FAILED`, `402 PAYMENT_WRONG_TOKEN`, `402 PAYMENT_WRONG_SENDER`,
`402 PAYMENT_WRONG_RECIPIENT`, `402 PAYMENT_INSUFFICIENT`,
`409 PAYMENT_ALREADY_USED`, `402 ALLOWANCE_DAILY_LIMIT`.

> **Product decision for a human:** `PAYMENTS_RECIPIENT` defaults to the
> treasury contract. The treasury's trading capital *is* its USDC balance,
> so subscription revenue would become agent trading capital. A separate
> revenue account is probably wanted. This is flagged in `docs/STATUS.md`
> and not decided here.

#### `GET /traces/access/allowance`, `PUT /traces/access/allowance` (auth)

Unchanged. `PUT` body `{ dailyLimit: number, perTraceLimit: number, currency?: "USDC" }`
(display USDC). Response: `SpendingAllowance | null`.

#### `GET /traces/payments` (auth)

The user's last 100 `PaymentEvent`s, newest first.

### Per-trace unlock via x402 (not this backend)

**Decision: the frontend calls the contracts repo's `x402/` service
directly** at `NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_URL`. The backend keeps daily-pass
subscriptions only and doesn't proxy x402.

Checked against `x402/trace-api.ts`: the service exposes
`GET /traces/:traceId`, where `:traceId` is the **on-chain** reasoning-registry
id (`onChainTraceId`), behind `@x402/express` `paymentMiddleware` with the
`exact` Stellar scheme. On payment it fetches the IPFS content, checks the
hash against the on-chain record, and returns
`{ traceId, traceHash, content }`. x402 is built so the client pays the
resource server, and a proxy would have to re-sign or forward payment
headers for no benefit.

Not verified: the contracts repo has no known x402-on-Stellar facilitator URL
(its `docs/STATUS.md`), so a full paid round-trip has never run.

### Portfolio

#### `GET /portfolio`

The agent's (treasury's) portfolio. Response:
`{ totalUsdc, deployedCapital, availableCapital, openPositions, totalPnl, dailyPnl, builderFeesEarned, correlationRisk, availableCapitalRaw }`.
`availableCapitalRaw` is `treasury.available_capital()` read live (`null` if
the RPC read fails). The float fields are the DB's view.

#### `GET /portfolio/positions`

Query `status`, `page`, `limit`. Response: `Position[]` with
`market { question, category, settlementCurrency, expiryTimestamp, onChainMarketId }`
and `trade { direction, amount, edgeDetected, kellyFraction, txHash }`.

#### `GET /portfolio/stats`

Platform counts from the database only:
`{ subscriberCount, totalCopyVolume, builderFees, marketCount, onChainMarketCount, traceCount }`.
The version in the unpushed commit `207464d` padded these with constants
(`+1284` subscribers, `+142000` volume); this one doesn't.

### Copy trade

The user signs `market_core.buy` in their own wallet. The backend records
intent and the resulting hash; it never trades for the user.

#### `POST /trade/copy` (auth)

Request `{ traceId: uuid, marketId: uuid, amountRaw: "10000000" }`.
Response:

```json
{
  "copyTradeId": "uuid",
  "transactionPayload": {
    "contractId": "C… (market-core)",
    "onChainMarketId": "0",
    "outcome": "Yes",
    "collateralInRaw": "10000000",
    "userWallet": "G…",
    "traceReference": "bafy…"
  },
  "instructions": "Quote, then sign market_core.buy with min_shares_out from the quote."
}
```

The direction comes from the trace's edge. The server refuses when there's
no trace, the edge is zero, or the market has no `onChainMarketId`
(`409 MARKET_NOT_ON_CHAIN`, `422 NO_EDGE`). `min_shares_out` isn't in the
payload because it must come from a quote taken right before signing.

#### `PATCH /trade/copy/:id/confirm` (auth)

Request `{ txHash }`. Stored as `EXECUTED`; the indexer reconciles it against
the market-core `trade` event.

### Oracle / resolution

Outcomes are decided on-chain by the `resolver` contract (Reflector price
specs or signer attestations, then `finalize_*`). **The backend never
decides an outcome.**

- `POST /oracle/resolve` is **removed**. It let any logged-in user resolve
  any market.

#### `GET /oracle/markets/:marketId/resolution`

`:marketId` is the backend UUID. Reads `resolver.state(onChainMarketId)` and
`market_core.get_market(onChainMarketId).status` live:

```json
{
  "marketId": "uuid",
  "onChainMarketId": "0",
  "resolverState": "Unconfigured" ,
  "marketStatus": { "tag": "Resolved", "outcome": "Yes" },
  "resolutionHash": "64-hex",
  "resolutionSpec": { },
  "dbStatus": "RESOLVED"
}
```

`resolverState` is `Unconfigured | SignersPending | Finalized`.
`marketStatus.tag` is `Open | Resolved | Void`. `404 MARKET_NOT_FOUND`,
`409 MARKET_NOT_ON_CHAIN`, `502 CHAIN_READ_FAILED`.

## Realtime (socket.io)

Same origin as the API without `/api/v1`. The frontend listens to these
events; event names are unchanged.

**Finding:** before this port the backend never emitted either event (there
is no `io.emit` anywhere in `src/`), so these listeners received nothing. The
indexer now emits them.

### `TRADE_EXECUTED`

Emitted when the indexer stores a market-core `trade` event.

```json
{
  "onChainMarketId": "0",
  "marketId": "uuid or null",
  "marketQuestion": "… or null",
  "trader": "G…",
  "direction": "YES",
  "isBuy": true,
  "collateralRaw": "10000000",
  "sharesRaw": "15873015",
  "feeRaw": "200000",
  "priceYesBps": 6421,
  "txHash": "64-hex",
  "ledger": 123456,
  "eventId": "0000…-0000000001"
}
```

The old payload had `amount` (float USDC), `price` (0–1) and `probChange`
(string). Frontends derive display values from `collateralRaw` and
`priceYesBps`.

### `REASONING_PUBLISHED`

Emitted when the indexer stores a reasoning-registry publish event.

```json
{
  "onChainTraceId": "3",
  "onChainMarketId": "0",
  "traceId": "uuid or null",
  "agent": "G…",
  "action": "buy",
  "ipfsCid": "bafy…",
  "traceHash": "64-hex",
  "txHash": "64-hex",
  "ledger": 123456
}
```
